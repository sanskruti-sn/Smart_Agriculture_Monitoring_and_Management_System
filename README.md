Smart_Agriculture_Monitoring_and_Management_System

It is a system that detects the health status of the crop. It first registers the farmer and his/her crop details. Then user has to sign in and get into the system. After successful sign in, the user is taken to "Smart Agriculture Dashboard". This dashboard has various tabs, such as Pests, Fertilizer, Market Prices, Irrigation, Harvest Records, Crop Health Monitoring, Weather Data, Sensors and Profile. Live weather data of temperature, humidity and precipitation is collected in the Weather Tab, based on the location of the farmer, which will be mentioned by the farmer, when he/she registers their crop. In my project, I have used dummy data of sensors for testing purpose. It has an hourly data retailed to Soil Moisture, PH of water, CO2, TDS. The sensors tab also has a facility to visualize the data in graph format. Based on the data collected in the Sensors tab and Weather Tab, a health status is given to the user of his/her crop in the Crop Health Monitoring tab. If their are any deficiencies in the crop, then in the out of range field, the deficiencies will get mentioned.
