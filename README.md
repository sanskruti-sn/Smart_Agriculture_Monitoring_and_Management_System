Smart Agriculture Monitoring & Management System

The Smart Agriculture Monitoring & Management System is designed to assess the health status of crops effectively. The process begins with the registration of the farmer and their crop details. Upon successful registration, users can sign in and access the system, leading them to the "Smart Agriculture Dashboard."

The dashboard features various tabs, including:

- Pests
- Fertilizer
- Market Prices
- Irrigation
- Harvest Records
- Crop Health Monitoring
- Weather Data
- Sensors
- Profile

In the "Weather Data" tab, live data on temperature, humidity, and precipitation is collected based on the farm's location specified during registration. 

For testing purposes, the project currently utilizes dummy sensor data.The system gathers hourly data on soil moisture, water pH, CO2 levels, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the "Sensors" tab. This tab also offers graphical visualizations of the collected data.

Using the information from the "Sensors" and "Weather Data" tabs, the system provides a health status update for the crops in the "Crop Health Monitoring" tab. Any deficiencies detected are highlighted in the "Out of Range" field.

For detailed instructions on using the software, please refer to the project manual.
